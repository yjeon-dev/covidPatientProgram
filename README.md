# covidPatientProgram

Because of the pandemic and the need to avoid the spread of COVID19, 


hospitals must screen patients and distinguish those who require a COVID test from those who do not.


In a timely manner, with patients being informed of the anticipated wait time and when they can be admitted to avoid long lines.
